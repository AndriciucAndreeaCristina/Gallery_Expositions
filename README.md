# Gallery Expositions

A new art gallery was birthed due to the implication of many contemporary artists who were told their art was not "good enough" for the big shelves. They have found a location that could host their exhibitions and events and are trying to keep track of everything that is happening.

The rooms could host either temporary or permanent exhibitions and they are divided into sections based on the movements represented by the artworks that are hosted in those rooms. Besides ehibitions, the art gallery can also organize events from various categories such as: Discussions, Tours, Courses, Creative workshops, Music.

The artworks that are shown in the gallery are created by passionate people, independent and upcoming artists and the visitors should be made aware of this by displaying some information on every collaborator such as: name, date of birth, movement it represents and a list of artworks.
For  every artwork, we should be able to identify the author, the year of creation, its title and a short description of what it depicts, but also the materials used in the making.
